// This TypeScript code snippet demonstrates how to create a simple console application that reads input from the user and prints it to the console. It doesn't perform any complex operations or logic beyond reading input.

function main() {
    const input = prompt("Please enter some text:");

    if (input) {
        console.log(`You entered: ${input}`);
    }
}

main();
